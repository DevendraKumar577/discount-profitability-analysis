# Discount & Profitability Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how different discount levels impact profitability and order count using Superstore order-level data.  
The goal is to identify discount ranges that drive sales versus those that lead to profit losses.

## Key Analysis
- Analyzed profit and order count across 4 discount bands (0–10%, 10–20%, 20–30%, 30%+).
- Identified that higher discount levels (30%+) consistently result in overall profit losses despite having orders.
- Observed that low discount bands (0–10%) generate the highest profit while maintaining a high number of orders.

## Tools & Technologies
- Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Dashboard)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy) – data cleaning & aggregation
- Git & GitHub

## Files in Repository
- `Discount_Profitability_Analysis.xlsx` – Excel dashboard and analysis
- `clean_superstore.csv` – cleaned dataset
- `discount_band_profit_loss.csv` – profit by discount band
- `profit_loss_count.csv` – order distribution by profit/loss
- `overall_summary.csv` – summary metrics

## Insights
This analysis highlights that aggressive discounting can hurt profitability and should be applied selectively based on business goals.
