## Key Analysis
- Analyzed profit and order count across 4 discount bands (0–10%, 10–20%, 20–30%, 30%+).
- Identified that higher discount levels (30%+) consistently result in overall profit losses despite having orders.
- Observed that low discount bands (0–10%) generate the highest profit while maintaining a high number of orders.

## Tools & Technologies
- Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Dashboard)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy) – data cleaning & aggregation
- Git & GitHub
